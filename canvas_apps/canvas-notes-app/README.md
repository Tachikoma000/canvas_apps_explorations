# Canvas Notes App

A React application that allows users to create and connect notes on an interactive canvas.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) for canvas interactions.

## Deploying to Vercel

This project is configured for easy deployment to Vercel. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the Vercel CLI installed: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Log in to Vercel: `vercel login`
3. From the project root directory, run: `vercel`
4. Follow the prompts to deploy your application

Alternatively, you can connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
3. Click "New Project" and import your repository
4. Vercel will detect React automatically and use the correct build settings
5. Click "Deploy"

The deployment is configured through the `vercel.json` file in the root directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
